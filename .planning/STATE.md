## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Build new React app rather than rewrite Angular — pending
- Spring Boot 2.7 → 3.2 upgrade lands as Phase 1 before all net-new code — pending
- Vertical-slice strangler-fig; Angular and React run side-by-side at distinct URL prefixes — pending
- ES Loader scheduler (Quartz vs `@Scheduled`+ShedLock) — **open decision**, lock in Phase 6 planning
- User-auth mechanism (CitiPortal / SiteMinder / SPNEGO) — deferred to Phase 9 planning
- Service-auth mechanism (Kerberos keytab / Vault) — deferred to Phase 9 planning
- Log-aggregator target (Splunk / ELK / Loki / OTel) — deferred to Phase 7 planning

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Backend tests are skipped by default (`maven.test.skip=true`) — addressed in Phase 0.
- Hyphen search bug is a daily user complaint — addressed in Phase 8 (fix benefits from alias indirection landed in Phase 6).
- recviz embed is the highest-uncertainty integration — written cross-team contract gated as Phase 4 entry criterion.
